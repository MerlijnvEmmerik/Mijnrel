The purpose of week 2 was firstly, to analyse the light curves of the planet "WASP-126 b". The properties of this stars is included in the file, along with the light curves. These show the time that another planet orbits the star. This can be seen by the dip in the light curve (when the phase equals zero), meaning that the light from the star is temporarily dimed.
An analysis was done on the planet TIC:55525572. This was done using "interm_tesscut_astroquery_of planet_55525572.ipynb" in which the Flux is shown in a picture. From this image, it can be seen that there are 6 nearby stars, of which the pixels observed from 3 stars seem to overlap with 55525572.
The file also includes a plot of an estimate of the background flux, which can be subtracted from the flux of the star in order to get a more accurate image of the flux of the star.
Finally, the file "The_animation_ploter" includes a nice animation of the planet 55525572 which is based on a function that takes the array, in which the frames are 2D image arrays. This file includes the phased and detrended light curves that runs through the frames. 
The latter three steps where repeated for the candidate, copied from Caltech and not yet confirmed by TESS to be a planet. The Analysis was done on the candidate TIC: 175310067. and is included in the file "interm_tesscut_astroquery_candidate_175310067.ipynb". The sectors are included and again, the same plots are included as for 55525572. From the plots, it can be seen that there are many more neighbouring stared when comparing to 5525572.
Lastly, the candidate was used to create an animation, but this was not successful as the candidates show not to be included in the database, where the confirmed planets are.
